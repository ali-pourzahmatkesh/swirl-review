						Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute
						between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or swirl ("claim(s)") must be
						resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not
						permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that
						would affect other swirl users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular
						claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this
						provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought
						in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.
					</Text>
					<Text style={[ appCss.defaultFontApp, styles.terms, styles.unorderedList ]}>
						<Text>{'\u2022'} </Text>
						<Text>
							Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court,
							if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims
							court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general
							jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The
							American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer
							Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.
						</Text>
						<Text>
							The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes
							related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our
							Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in
							unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope
							and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.
						</Text>
						<Text>
							You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms.
							To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone
							number you use for your swirl account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of
							this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here:
							<TouchableOpacity
								onPress={() => this.openURL("mailto:feedback@test.com")}

								<Text style={{ color: 'blue' }}> info@realswirlapp.com</Text>
							</TouchableOpacity>
						</Text>


					</Text>
					<Text style={[ appCss.defaultFontApp, styles.terms, styles.unorderedList ]}>
						<Text>{'\u2022'} </Text>
						Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute
						that includes your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for
						your swirl account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice
						of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to swirl. Before we commence arbitration, we will
						send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your swirl account, or other
						appropriate means. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the
						Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.

						The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal
						law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
