## Upate
You also need to go in a change a line in a node_module file to prevent gifs
from looping for the app entry animation.

From the top directory of the project:
    cd node_modules/react-native/Libraries/Image
    
Open `RCTGIFImageDecoder.m` and change: `animation.repeatCount = loopCount == 0 ? HUGE_VALF : loopCount;
`
to:
`animation.repeatCount = loopCount == 0 ? 0 : loopCount;`
